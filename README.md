- When we have multiple network interfaces, how we quickly determine (1) what interface we 
  are using to reach the internet (or that network), (2) what the IP address is for that interface,
  and (3) what our subnet masking is, using the fewest lines of code possible?
  determineHowWeReachedInternet.sh
  
- Test whether an argument has been sent to the script:<br>
  elegantTestWhetherArgExists.sh
 
- Check to see whether we have updates (and security updates) available:<br>
  (yeah, I know apt does this and drops it into the motd, but what if I want to check what's currently there for some reason?)
  aptListNumberPackagesUpgradeable.sh
  
 - Pull uname data, format it, and use lables from a file:<br>
   workingWithUname.sh
<br><br><br><br>

I'm good if you have suggestions - especially if it makes the programs run faster or more elegantly.

(My ego is used to being knocked down - I'm married.)
