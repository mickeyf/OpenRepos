#How to mount a samba share with cifs (UBUNTU)

1. apt-get install cifs-utils

2. Create a directory for your local mountpoint.

3. Create a credentials file (for instance: "cifs.credential.file") for cifs to use which contains:

	user=<share user name>
	password=<password>
	workgroup=<if you are set up for workgroups>

4. now issue the command (requires root priv):

	mount.cifs //<hostname_or_ip>/<cifs_share> <local_mountpoint>,rw,credentials=<path_to_the_credentials_file>

5. Test your mount by accessing the local mountpoint directory.

6. Add to fstab, if desired (for automouning on reboot, etc.)

	nano /etc/fstab

	add this line:

	# <file system> <dir> <type> <options>                                                   <dump>  <pass>
//WIN_SHARE_IP/share_name  /mnt/win_share  cifs  credentials=/etc/win-credentials,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755 0       0
